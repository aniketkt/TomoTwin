**TomoTwin** is a simple digital twin for synchrotron tomography that provides an API to generate realistic grayscale tomography datasets from ground-truth (labeled) volumes as training data for denoising and segmentation models. The grayscale data mimics imaging artifacts such as noise and in-line phase contrast with a dependence on the instrument parameters such as detector configuration and beam energy.
